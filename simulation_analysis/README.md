This folder contains the python scripts used to simulate figure 1, figure 2 and figure 3 in Tromp et al (2022) (https://rdcu.be/cOk1l). Figure 1 and 2 can be reproduced using the PCTC-gain-model-JT.py script. Figure 3 can be reproduced using the GRAIN-gain-model-JT.py script. Furthermore, one is of course also invited to play around with model parameters (defined in variables at the top of the script) to investigate how the model behaves. 

There is also a PCTC-script where we play around with noise, and a PCTC-script where we play around with ranges of PC-gain values (see supplementary materials in the article). These are not uploaded here, but of course if you are interested you can contact me so I can share them with you.

The models were run using Python 3.8.
