# Modelling neural gain and control in the Stroop task
The simulation_analysis repository contains the scripts and data necessary to reproduce figure 1(c,d),2 and 3 from the paper: The Effects of Neural Gain on Reactive Cognitive Control (Tromp et al, 2022; https://rdcu.be/cOk1l).

The empirical_analysis repository contains an rmarkdown file reproducing the statistical analysis described in the result section of that same paper.
